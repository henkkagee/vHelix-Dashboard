Workflow/pipeline for generating a sequence and model from a .ply or .obj model:

1) Import a .ply or .obj file from File->Import, or copy it to the workspace folder in the file explorer

2) Click on the .ply/.obj file you imported in the workspace window (lower left pane) to select it

3) With the file selected, select a design method from the Design menu. Here you can specify some options for running the design. You can also estimate the base usage/scaffold strand length. Click ok to run the design with the selected options

4) If the design is successful, you should see it in the console (upper left panel) and an .oxview file should appear in the workspace

5) To view the model in the graphics panel, double click the .oxview file. For a better experience and edit features, use OxView (https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer).

6) Once the 3D model appears on the right (3D performance not yet optimized), you can export the strands as a .csv file from Export->Export strand sequences. You can also do this with OxView

7) You can rotate the model using the right mouse button and translate the camera using the left mouse button. Use shift+arrow keys or the scroll wheel for zooming.

8) You can modify some settings from Help -> settings

	 * by calling a executeCommandOnIdle we can avoid this by postponing the execution until later.
	 * However, the OnIdle version allows the user to undo the action, which is very strange.
	 * By implementing it as a MPxCommand that is NOT undoable, Maya won't try to undo it.
	 * It's a long shot but it works
